          The Overseer <br> <br>
The Original Founder of the Movement himself, he is connected to The Network and Command. Through which he Oversees The Nation. Often taking an indirect role in affairs of State. Able to shut down any Knight's suit to prevent the extremly small chance of insubordination. Residing in The Floating Captial, at its very center.

      Each Region has a Praetorian who overseers all Knights within their Region, in charge of approving recruitment of new knights and meets in The Praetorian Council to dicuss and vote about major National decisions.
                  Each Praetorian was highly experienced and loyal members of The Movement, often coming from high ranking individuals from The Great War. Unlike lower ranks, in peacetime and out of War Game scenarios they still play a vitial role in running The Nation and Maintaining The Knights. Being far more Political in nature, having to work with Elected Regional Chancellors and The Heads of Various Unions, such as the Science or Art Unions.</p>

          Under the Praetorians are The Centurions, operating as commanders of around 100 Knights. Centurions often reside in State Town centers where they can quickly travel to visit and oversee the garrisions of surrounding County's. Outside of war games or actual war, they have little to no responsibility's. Their ability's and responsibility's focus on organising Knights and supporting military forces. Working as field commanders for Standard military forces.

                            Standard Knights <br> <br>
                            The bulk of The Knights, many of whom fought in The Great War. Often form garrisions in urban centers, and have no real role outside of military related affairs. They tend to thus blend into the citizen population, with a lot of free time. The Knights are the best The Nation has to offer and the selection process is very strict and carefull. Most citizens do not see Knights close up, or know to much about them and thus their position in Socity is legendary.
                            They are loyal to Command however, and are ready to step in to ensure The Nation remains on course to its goals. 
                            Their Suits are incredible peices of Tech. Its Blue Body Suits while offering resistance to incoming fire and physical damage. Contains artifical muscle's that are also capable of self healing and manipulation by the user. A Knight through prolonged training and exposure to A Suit will naturally improve in skill and ability. Their suits adjusting overtime to how the user operates them, becoming more efficent and adapted to The User itself.
