        Incredibly proud and partly Autonomus, the Science Union is split into multiple divisions. Each based on a respective and broad fields. Which Each Region containing a number of Science Union Facility's. Each divison elects a Head Scientist to represent them, and work with Regional Chancellors and Praetorian's. Holding a very respected position in The Nation's leadership for Each Region.
      <br> <br> Note: The Rivially between the division's is encouraged to spur compertion and innovation, while remaining friendly in nature (mostly)

        The Bio Division: <br><br>
        Like any Division they are incredibly proud of their work, especially having decoded the building blocks of life
        itself. Able to manipulate cells and DNA as a programer could write lines of Code. They are repsonsible often
        for improving existing or creating new life to adapt to the harsh Climate of The 22nd Century
        Their main rivials are the Robitics Division, whom they compete often with to make better 'creations'. Beliving
        anything biological is better than anything Robotic.
        Their feild has lead to the irradication of all disease's and have lead to a carefully created strain of Human,
        that is both able to survive the Harsh environment and fitter and healthier than any normal human being before
        The Nation. This of course was limited to ensure that The Nation remains an Empire of Humanity, and it is
        forbidden to modify a humans mental state.
        They are responsible for all physical healthcare and the Reproduction of The Human Race, growing new generations
        of Humans.

        The Robotics Division: <br><br>
        Often Rivials of the Bio Division, due to their competing focus on making certain Machines and equipment.
        Their colaboration has lead to a mix of biological and Robotic techs, as found in the blue scaled skin that can
        be seen in Knghts Armor and Machines that require moving parts such as Walkers.
        They often strive to make The Nation more efficent, only held back by the Social Division which deems total
        automation as a risk to Social Cohesion.
        They can be incredibly adapatable at figuring out tech and how it works.

        The Social Division: <br><br>
        No Society can be built to last without propor social plannings. This Division carefully study's Humanity itself
        and constantly works across The Nation to ensure and maintain Social Cohesion. Thus they have influenced how
        City's are designed and Education Systems operate. Thus The Nation is able to maintain A unifying and Cohesive
        Culture.
        They are frequiently at odds with other divisions of the Science Union, because they step in and add a new layer
        of thinking that more straight forward logical thinkers would not consider. The Importance of how human's think
        and operate is always thus taken into consideration, much to the dismay of their peers.

        The Physics Division: <br><br>
        In charge of exploring the building blocks of the universe and the limits of reality, unlike the other divisions they push into the theoretical at a greater extreme. Working on the Technology that allows for the opening between Reality's: The Creation of The Multiverse Portal's
      They have little rivialy or even contact with other divisions as their feild is often self contained in nature.

          The Astro-Geo Division: <br><br>
          Having no rivials for obvious reasons, they study Geography on Earth and on planets and moons across the Solar System. Identifying sites across the land and ocean floor sutible for minning and building if necessary. They often work with The Bio Division to ensure the introduction of new species in appropriate areas.
        Often made fun of by other Divisions for being boring and to "down to earth" in nature. They often push for manned missions across the Solar System, but Command has other plans.

        Social Branch of the Science Union: <br><br>
        
        <bold>Introduction:</bold> The world is united at last, long live The Nation of humanity. So, with the establishment of the Science Union (SC for short), we so far are made up almost entirely of Knights who branched off to form the SC. This of course limits our operational capacity due to lack of numbers. The world’s population has dwindled into the millions, as continuing to rise temperatures and pollution has left most of the Earth uninhabitable. Thankfully our sterilization program was almost enterally successful, preventing the natural birth of any children who would be incapable of surviving for more than a few days at best. The Remaining populations are being relocated to the now available northern and southern landmass’s, now ice free. It is estimated they too will die off in the next decade. Some have argued for humane euthanasia, to which is still up for debate. 
        The Knights being the only humans capable of survival are finding themselves the last human beings standing, and many are called for a repopulation program. A request that is in the process of being approved. Many steps will have to be taken for the establishment of a New World Order that can last the test of time. 
        That is why the SC have formed a Sociology branch It is one thing to build the infrastructure and develop means of resource generation. It’s another thing to establish a social system that will fit the goals and standards of The Nation. Many of us didn’t think we could get this far, but here we are. So, we must get this right the first time, changes later will be more difficult and risk a renewal of past mistakes our species has made. 
        We have managed as many of you know to have modified and created a strain of humans that we will begin production after the set up of the final Urban enclaves. This means that we must develop an entire social system from the ground up, a mammoth task that will be almost as difficult as restoring the Earths ecosystems to their former glory.  We first must create a political system that can effectively represent our entire population, secondly, we must educate these new citizens, and thirdly have a stable growth till we reach what we can determine as an acceptable cap in human population.  That is why this draft project sets out a model for a social system that will practically meet the goals of an Empire for Humanity, that will last the tests of time. A New Civilisation.
