        <bold>Introduction: <br><br></bold> The world is united at last, long live The Nation of humanity. So, with the
        establishment of the Science Union (SC for short), we so far are made up almost entirely of Knights who branched
        off to form the SC. This of course limits our operational capacity due to lack of numbers. The world’s
        population has dwindled into the millions, as continuing to rise temperatures and pollution has left most of the
        Earth uninhabitable. Thankfully our sterilization program was almost enterally successful, preventing the
        natural birth of any children who would be incapable of surviving for more than a few days at best. The
        Remaining populations are being relocated to the now available northern and southern landmass’s, now ice free.
        It is estimated they too will die off in the next decade. Some have argued for humane euthanasia, to which is
        still up for debate.
        The Knights being the only humans capable of survival are finding themselves the last human beings standing, and
        many are called for a repopulation program. A request that is in the process of being approved. Many steps will
        have to be taken for the establishment of a New World Order that can last the test of time.
        That is why the SC have formed a Sociology branch It is one thing to build the infrastructure and develop means
        of resource generation. It’s another thing to establish a social system that will fit the goals and standards of
        The Nation. Many of us didn’t think we could get this far, but here we are. So, we must get this right the first
        time, changes later will be more difficult and risk a renewal of past mistakes our species has made.
        We have managed as many of you know to have modified and created a strain of humans that we will begin
        production after the set up of the final Urban enclaves. This means that we must develop an entire social system
        from the ground up, a mammoth task that will be almost as difficult as restoring the Earths ecosystems to their
        former glory. We first must create a political system that can effectively represent our entire population,
        secondly, we must educate these new citizens, and thirdly have a stable growth till we reach what we can
        determine as an acceptable cap in human population. That is why this draft project sets out a model for a social
        system that will practically meet the goals of an Empire for Humanity, that will last the tests of time. A New
        Civilisation.

        An Educational System that lasts a lifetime: <br><br>

        Anyone who remembers the old ways of education knows that classes of students would work day in and day out in
        Schools for 12 years or more, before being thrown out into the world and expected to succeed suddenly of their
        own merits and motivations. Failing to understand that the previous system of schools had left many unprepared
        for such a transition, leaving many behind and creating a vast unequal playing field throughout history. 
        However, what this school system provides is a model of success, perhaps on a greater scale. Education is a
        process that doesn’t and should not be thought to end after a student finish’s the 12th Grade. That is why this
        proposed model ensures that a citizen will continue to be educated for their entire lives, keeping up the
        academic skills developed in these years and refining them further and to new ends. 
        With the production of humans that can survive this damaged world, new children will be raised in what many
        could deem to be state run orphanages. This provides the perfect means to carefully craft and foster a culture
        of learning and equality between all students that will last a lifetime. With the establishment of state-run
        centres that will raise students in different levels varying on the students age. This of course would require a
        vast number of staff and qualified individuals. 
        Now the development of a model of education from birth till what many deemed adulthoods in the past to be: 18
        years of age. Is a different topic enterally, that will be a system that will be developed to perfection. What
        this report is arguing is a system that extends what a school is, indefinitely.
        Classrooms provide an example of small numbers of teachers, motivating and propelling large classes of
        individuals to pursue incredible goals and complete countless task with no pay or real punishment for failure.
        This is a model of success that doesn’t need to end at 18. In fact, it should be a life long affair. This model
        extending to providing a future workforce and skills for society whilst also installing every citizen a sense of
        belonging and advancement. Thus it is proposed that instead of primary, middle, high school etc. Students will
        enter a new level of schooling, that becomes more practical and elective based but still requires compulsory
        educational subjects. As students progress then through their year levels, they will become better skilled and
        given more responsibility as apart of their continued work experience. What this allows for is an entire work
        force that can be developed and directed depending on need.
        <br><br>Note: Now automation will cover many fields and require little to no human workforce, but this won’t be
        enterally covered nor will that be socially acceptable to have all jobs run by machines. Even if its arguably
        more efficient. I say this to the dismay of those who formed The Robitic's Division. They will have to limit their utopian dream of automation if it cannot maintain social cohesion.
