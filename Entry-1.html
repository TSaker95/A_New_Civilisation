        <bold>Introduction: <br><br></bold> The world is united at last, long live The Nation of humanity. So, with the
        establishment of the Science Union (SC for short), we so far are made up almost entirely of Knights who branched
        off to form the SC. This of course limits our operational capacity due to lack of numbers. The world’s
        population has dwindled into the millions, as continuing to rise temperatures and pollution has left most of the
        Earth uninhabitable. Thankfully our sterilization program was almost enterally successful, preventing the
        natural birth of any children who would be incapable of surviving for more than a few days at best. The
        Remaining populations are being relocated to the now available northern and southern landmass’s, now ice free.
        It is estimated they too will die off in the next decade. Some have argued for humane euthanasia, to which is
        still up for debate.
        The Knights being the only humans capable of survival are finding themselves the last human beings standing, and
        many are called for a repopulation program. A request that is in the process of being approved. Many steps will
        have to be taken for the establishment of a New World Order that can last the test of time.
        That is why the SC have formed a Sociology branch It is one thing to build the infrastructure and develop means
        of resource generation. It’s another thing to establish a social system that will fit the goals and standards of
        The Nation. Many of us didn’t think we could get this far, but here we are. So, we must get this right the first
        time, changes later will be more difficult and risk a renewal of past mistakes our species has made.
        We have managed as many of you know to have modified and created a strain of humans that we will begin
        production after the set up of the final Urban enclaves. This means that we must develop an entire social system
        from the ground up, a mammoth task that will be almost as difficult as restoring the Earths ecosystems to their
        former glory. We first must create a political system that can effectively represent our entire population,
        secondly, we must educate these new citizens, and thirdly have a stable growth till we reach what we can
        determine as an acceptable cap in human population. That is why this draft project sets out a model for a social
        system that will practically meet the goals of an Empire for Humanity, that will last the tests of time. A New
        Civilisation.

        An Educational System that lasts a lifetime: <br><br>

        Anyone who remembers the old ways of education knows that classes of students would work day in and day out in
        Schools for 12 years or more, before being thrown out into the world and expected to succeed suddenly of their
        own merits and motivations. Failing to understand that the previous system of schools had left many unprepared
        for such a transition, leaving many behind and creating a vast unequal playing field throughout history.
        However, what this school system provides is a model of success, perhaps on a greater scale. Education is a
        process that doesn’t and should not be thought to end after a student finish’s the 12th Grade. That is why this
        proposed model ensures that a citizen will continue to be educated for their entire lives, keeping up the
        academic skills developed in these years and refining them further and to new ends.
        With the production of humans that can survive this damaged world, new children will be raised in what many
        could deem to be state run orphanages. This provides the perfect means to carefully craft and foster a culture
        of learning and equality between all students that will last a lifetime. With the establishment of state-run
        centres that will raise students in different levels varying on the students age. This of course would require a
        vast number of staff and qualified individuals.
        Now the development of a model of education from birth till what many deemed adulthoods in the past to be: 18
        years of age. Is a different topic enterally, that will be a system that will be developed to perfection. What
        this report is arguing is a system that extends what a school is, indefinitely.
        Classrooms provide an example of small numbers of teachers, motivating and propelling large classes of
        individuals to pursue incredible goals and complete countless task with no pay or real punishment for failure.
        This is a model of success that doesn’t need to end at 18. In fact, it should be a life long affair. This model
        extending to providing a future workforce and skills for society whilst also installing every citizen a sense of
        belonging and advancement. Thus it is proposed that instead of primary, middle, high school etc. Students will
        enter a new level of schooling, that becomes more practical and elective based but still requires compulsory
        educational subjects. As students progress then through their year levels, they will become better skilled and
        given more responsibility as apart of their continued work experience. What this allows for is an entire work
        force that can be developed and directed depending on need.
        <br><br>Note: Now automation will cover many fields and require little to no human workforce, but this won’t be
        enterally covered nor will that be socially acceptable to have all jobs run by machines. Even if its arguably
        more efficient. I say this to the dismay of those who formed The Robitic's Division. They will have to limit
        their utopian dream of automation if it cannot maintain social cohesion.

        Structuring A New Education system: <BR> <BR>
        Ages 0- 12: kids as most kids do at these ages require a lot of attention and assistance in development. With
        educational programs adjusted according to age and ability.<br> <br>
        Ages 12-18: Students at this stage will increase in individual ability and attributes, with clear differences in
        personality and ability’s at the start of adolescence.<br> <br>
        Ages 18-22: As an example was often a time of university education in the 21st century, this would be a new
        section of school that could be named accordingly to this period in their schooling. In this time, students will
        be able to focus study on electives and thus practical work experience based on their interests as well as
        compulsory subjects that would depend on their local needs. For example, a student could be required to do
        shifts at their local mining facility if need be. This would be practical work experience and they would have to
        complete this compulsorily. They would also at this point develop interests and skills in certain fields that
        they would wish to pursue further. Thus, they could then complete practical work experience in lets say a health
        department. Able to then study more in that field in the classroom, while working shifts in that practical
        environment. All the while they would have compulsory basic subjects that they would be required to continue
        like all other students. This could be all put in a schedule that works around needed and available jobs.
        <br> <br> Ages 22-Onward: At this point many students will have a lot of practical experience they could apply
        to a
        variety of jobs. Meaning that students at this point will be a vast workforce that can be flexibility adjusted
        quickly if need be. Depending on their fields they would spend more and more time in the workplace than in the
        classroom, but this can be worked around. With all citizens still required to complete basic subjects, at bare
        minimum maintaining their academic skills and allowing for constant education on topics as society develops new
        understandings and gains new information.

        Military Service: <br> <br>
        Now military service is a debatable field, how can one foster a culture of individual and equitable growth while
        a military has historically been a system of hierarchy and oppression. Built a upon systems that break down
        people into fighting and killing machines. That is a question to be answered in different reports, but military
        service is an avenue that some may pursue, and society may deem necessary in future for what ever reason. Alas
        it is unlikely that any war could ever break out on earth again, such threats would have to come from outside
        the Empire. One reason is that the civilian governments would feel a need for defence, with each region having
        its own military it can raise and maintain. Its also a proposed idea, to have War Games. A sport that allows
        military forces from across the nation to train and compete in fantastic events against each other. Thus to
        direct the ideas of violence and war that may arise among the population into a healthy and perhaps useful
        direction.

        Further Notes: <br> <br>
        All Students and thus citizens will have guidance councillors as well as therapists that as a profession will
        ensure the mental and emotional wellbeing of every citizen. On top of physical experts to ensure all citizens
        can remain physically healthy and engaged in community sporting events. Plus with a the basic levels of human
        endurance and strength improved upon with the modified strain of humans that we intend to produce. We will
        create a generation that at least in theory, is happier and healthier than any point in human history.

        Conclusion, thoughts on the future: <br> <br>

        Now a few may argue it would be easy to simply create a mindless class of “prolls” and simply have the knights
        remain an elite party that rules over them. We very well can do that, however that would be against everything
        we stand for. Such suggestions have been faced with bitter scorn even if hypothetical. We are crafting an Empire
        for humanity, that will restore the Earth and redeem history itself. To do what would be easy would be a slap in
        the face to everything we fought for.
        This system will allow for a society that will forever be adaptable and ensure a happy and motivated citizenry.
        A system that will ensure that as a society we can keep citizens engaged and educated across their lifetime. It
        ensures a workforce that can be adjusted towards any task or change in priority’s.
        This system will be Worldwide, so that every citizen will be taught a language and culture that is identical.
        With a political system that will represent them, with our oversight. This of course would adjust overtime
        naturally, something that must be considered in the next 100 years. We shall have collected enough data to
        adjust a course of action for the 23rd Century when it arrives.
