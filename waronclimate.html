                Introduction: <br><br>
                The time has come that it is not only too late to do nothing about climate change, but too late for
                gradual steps to reduce our ecological impact on this planet. Humanity must declare war on climate
                change and all those responsible. This document signifies the actions that will be taken immediately to
                address this crisis.
                <br><br>
                War time economy:<br> <br>
                The entire nation, and all nations if possible are to immediately put all their energy into fighting the
                war on climate change as follows:
                Nationalisation of all banks and industry’s: The Economic power of this nation, and others shall be put
                into the hands of the government. All matters of production shall be aimed and tooled towards fighting
                climate change. <br> <br>
                Rationing: <br> <br> All food services such as supermarkets and farms will be incorporated into the state. Food
                production will be limited as much as possible, with a total ban on animal farming. Remaining animals
                will be gradually slaughtered for rationing purposes. Until an acceptable population of farm animals
                remain. Remaining farm animal populations will be preserved to prevent their extinction. Farmland used
                for cash crops or food for animal production will be converted into food production for human
                consumption if possible. With unused farmland to be reclaimed by nature. <br> <br>
                Transportation: <br> <br>All fossil fuelled vehicles are to be banned, with exception to emergency vehicles,
                essential personal, mandated supply vehicles and those who require them in special circumstances such as
                disability reasons.
