     After Century's of Ignorance, The Science Union was created to make and maintain the light of knowledge for all of Humanity. Fiercy independent and autonomus, their pusuit of science is almost fanatical in nature. Kept in check only by the Praetorians and The Overseeer himself.

        Social Branch of the Science Union: <br><br>
        
        <bold>Introduction:</bold> The world is united at last, long live the empire of humanity. So, with the establishment of the Science Union (SC for short), we so far are made up almost entirely of Knights who branched off to form the SC. This of course limits our operational capacity due to lack of numbers. The world’s population has dwindled into the millions, as continuing to rise temperatures and pollution has left most of the Earth uninhabitable. Thankfully our sterilization program was almost enterally successful, preventing the natural birth of any children who would be incapable of surviving for more than a few days at best. The Remaining populations are being relocated to the now available northern and southern landmass’s, now ice free. It is estimated they too will die off in the next decade. Some have argued for humane euthanasia, to which is still up for debate. 
        The Knights being the only humans capable of survival are finding themselves the last human beings standing, and many are called for a repopulation program. A request that is in the process of being approved. Many steps will have to be taken for the establishment of a New World Order that can last the test of time. 
        That is why the SC have formed a Sociology branch It is one thing to build the infrastructure and develop means of resource generation. It’s another thing to establish a social system that will fit the goals and standards of The Nation. Many of us didn’t think we could get this far, but here we are. So, we must get this right the first time, changes later will be more difficult and risk a renewal of past mistakes our species has made. 
        We have managed as many of you know to have modified and created a strain of humans that we will begin production after the set up of the final Urban enclaves. This means that we must develop an entire social system from the ground up, a mammoth task that will be almost as difficult as restoring the Earths ecosystems to their former glory.  We first must create a political system that can effectively represent our entire population, secondly, we must educate these new citizens, and thirdly have a stable growth till we reach what we can determine as an acceptable cap in human population.  That is why this draft project sets out a model for a social system that will practically meet the goals of an Empire for Humanity, that will last the tests of time. A New Civilisation.
