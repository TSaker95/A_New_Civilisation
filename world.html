                With The Nation organised into 375 Regions, there is political structure in place to ensure human
                representation across the Earth. Working with other elected members or specailists from organisations
                such as the Science Union, the representative government ensures Social Cohesion and that all citizens
                of The Nation have their needs met. All Elected representatives have their identity hidden while in
                public or parlimentary sessions, to limit the forming of factions, voting blocks or the unlikely chance
                of outside influence.
                <br><br> Note: Any elected Representative is not above being charged for Treason, deposed or excecutued
                if
                deemed neccessary by Command or the Inquistion. Any Behaviour or action that goes against the interest
                of The Nation will not be taken lightly.
