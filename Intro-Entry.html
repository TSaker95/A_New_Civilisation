                    Preamble: The Following report has been assembled from the memories of the now MIA Praetorian: Di’Inferi. With recovered memories from the (Status unknown) Head scientist In charge of the project: Operation Redemption, providing additional information on what happened in today’s incident. <br> <br>
                    I closed my eyes and felt the Cameras click on around the lab, loading up instantly. Opening their lenses to witness the sight before them. Through these I could now see everything. The room was alive with activity, technicians rushed around between consoles, working tirelessly away to stabilise the breakthrough they had finally made. Behind them the Knights, my comrades; stood guard. Silently watching the room, their four glowing red eyes piercing the shadows. The massive drain on power had brought down most of the lights in the room to emergency levels, and all energy was directed towards the Machine at the centre. Myself, I stood in front of this machine. Awaiting my responsibility, after all this time we have finally found what we were looking for. Suddenly One technician turned to one of the more prominent Scientists in the room, standing elevated above the machine and myself. Carefully watching over his team. “Head Scientist, we… its…..It has been found, should we attempt to make a connection?” Asked the technician, terror in her voice. The Head scientist looked at her for a moment and smiled. Nodding confidently. “Go ahead” The Head scientist replied. We all watched in awe as the hum of the machine grew louder and the portal lit up into an unexplainable coloured ripple. Finally this project was a reality, all our work a success. On the other side of that portal however was a place nothing like our own. The space between worlds starting to merge, a doorway between them opened and a cold breeze swept into the room. It was time, I thought. “Proceed Praetorian, do what must be done!” The Head Scientist yelled. I nodded and stepped towards the machine and its shimmering portal. Suddenly a presence became clear to me. I couldn’t see it with the cameras, my suits senses or my own eyes, but I could feel it. A Red-faced monster with a pale white body, spiked all over, with multiple long slender arms with vicious claws. Its teeth like long needles, it had a human like face but the mouth of something else enterally. The thing ignored me and instead moved towards the head scientist. I could see him skin shiver, and his body tense with the feeling of a presence that he could not see but felt was there. Suddenly it came into focus for a split second its horrific face simply being glimpsed by the scientist for just a moment in time, but that was enough. “Shut it off, shut it off” He Screamed. “No!” I yelled. We had come to far to give up now. I jumped into the portal anyway, regardless of safety. ‘I will save the world, I will save humanity once more’ I thought just as I went through. Suddenly blinded by a flash of light. ***** Connection lost. ***** - Memory’s backed up to Network for Review. <br> <br> 
                    Connection to Praetorian Di’Inferi is lost. Report Continues from recovered memories of the Scientist in charge of this project. Presented in written format, limiting descriptions of emotional and physical distress to a necessary degree for this report. <br> <br>
                    Terror struck me, as I witnessed the things face. I felt a stone-cold Hand Grab my arm just as the machine turned off, and the Monster disappeared. It’s Red Face leaving a terrifying image in my mind, but at least I was now safe. I didn’t expect anything like that when I started this project, nor did I have any explanation. All I could process now was a sense of relief. I looked at my arm, where the thing had touched me…. There was a black mark across it and suddenly I was in unimaginable pain. I Screamed and screamed as my arm where it was touched fell apart and chunks seemed to evaporate away into the air. I could do nothing but scream in agony, collapsing to my knees.  Paralysed in pain. The evaporation stopped, and my team could do nothing but stare in terror as blood poured out of the wounds as I faded out from Shock. Two Knights stepped forward and picked up my body. “Project aborted, this facility is now on lockdown.” said a voice over the intercom. “Take the Head Scientist to the medical bay for recovery, quarantine and study… Bring the arm and its remains”. That was the last thing I heard before the world went silent. **** Memory ends *** <br> <br>
                    Conclusion: This report and any further information on the event shall be passed ONLY to Command and The Praetorian Council. All remaining staff have been noted that failure to comply to total secrecy, shall be sentenced to a minimum detention of 10 years. As Di’Inferi has not returned or made contact, and the fact that we all remain. Means that Operation Redemption, is a likely failure. <br> <br>
